# liteCV
**_liteCV_** is lightweight image processing library for C++11.  
Unlike _OpenCV_, **_liteCV_** must be **SIMPLE**.  
Unlike _OpenCV_, **_liteCV_** must be **INDEPENDENCE**.

# Achievements
The main achievement of *_liteCV_* is providing equivalence with OpenCV.  
Especially, we are focusing implementing OpenCV's `core`, `imgproc` and `imgcodec`.

## Data Structure
1. Element (equivalent to `cv::Vec`/`cv::Scalar`)
2. Size (equivalent to `cv::Size`)
3. Point (equivalent to `cv::Point`)
4. Rect (equivalent to `cv::Rect`)
5. Matrix (equivalent to `cv::Mat`)
